A repo for all the small things I do that don't really deserve their own repo.

## colorLearner
While talking with my girlfriend about the different
colors, shape, etc that different fungi can take on
she thought it would be interesting to have a program
which could show you a bunch of colors and learn from
input to try and make the same interesting patterns.

Turns out human reinforced learning without datasets
is **really** slow. So this project isn't that fun
or interesting to play with. But hey, if you have an 
hour and want to make it try and learn to make a zebra
pattern, it's probably possible.


## Evil Hangman
I had a friend who was doing a minor in CSC at a
different university than me. A particularily 
interesting assignment he was given was to create
an instance of a game called "Evil Hangman". The
premise of this game is that the computer will
attempt to select the last possible word that
would still validly meet your requirements.
In other words, the computer cheats by not
selecting a word until it absolutely has to.

He needed help with this project, so in order
to properly help get him unstuck, I created my
own Evil Hangman in Python (his was in C).
This helped me get an understanding of the 
problem he was stuck at so I could help lead
him out of the hole he dug himself.
