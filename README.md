A repo for all the small things I do that don't really deserve their own repo.

## colorLearner
While talking with my girlfriend about the different
colors, shape, etc that different fungi can take on
she thought it would be interesting to have a program
which could show you a bunch of colors and learn from
input to try and make the same interesting patterns.

Turns out human reinforced learning without datasets
is **really** slow. So this project isn't that fun
or interesting to play with. But hey, if you have an 
hour and want to make it try and learn to make a zebra
pattern, it's probably possible.
